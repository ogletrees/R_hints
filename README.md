# R_hints
A place for the things I forget in R.

In learning and working with R to process data and clean it I have to go google things. Often I land on StackOverflow where many helpful people provide the answers I seek. I learn alot, but with some tasks I always seem to be googling the same thing.  
Here I will try to document those things so that I don't have to go search so often.  

If you find this among all of the interwebs hopefully it will be helpful to you too.
